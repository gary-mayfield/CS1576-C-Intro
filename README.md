Introduction to programming with C++ is a hands-on introductory short course and the first part of a study of the C/C++ family of languages, used to build most of the world's computing systems. Starting with programming basics, then focusing on applying programming practise into the C/C++ programming language, it teaches key features of imperative programming using C and is an ideal preliminary to Object-Oriented Programming using C++.
